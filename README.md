# Blackjack
The popular (multiplayer?) card game, brought to you in a completely virtual format! 

## Description
Also known as "twenty-one", Blackjack pits each player against the dealer. Their task is to accumulate a hand of cards that totals as close to 21 as possible without exceeding 21. On their turn, players choose to either "HIT" (draw another card) or "STAY" (take no more cards). Once someone's hand exceeds 21, they automatically "BUST". Cards are totaled based on face value, where Jacks, Queens, and Kings are all worth 10, and Aces have a dynamic value of either 1 or 11. At the end of a round, all active players whose cards total higher than the dealer's win. If a player's hand is equal to the dealer's hand, there is a tie (neither of them wins).
